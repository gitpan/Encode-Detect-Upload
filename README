Encode-Detect-Upload

Users who can upload text files will usually have no idea what charset they are in.
In fact, the majority probably don't even know what a charset is, and telling them
to only upload files in UTF-8 can lead to much confusion. This module does it's
best to make an accurate guess at what charset the file is in, so that it may be
parsed correctly. It takes into account the users IP and browser environment
variables, along with Mozilla's charset detection library.

We've been using this module in production for over a year and it's saved us a lot
of support headaches.
